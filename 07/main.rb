# This is becoming complex, can you find the proper method to log our code?
#
# Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.
#   next: jumps to the next line of the code
#   step: jumps inside a method
#   continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint
#
# USEFUL
#   information.methods - 1.methods
#   information.methods.grep /something/

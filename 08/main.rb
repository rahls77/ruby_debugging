# Our method is clearly there, right? What is wrong with this code?
#
# Challenges:
#   1. Fix the problem
#   2. Can you explain why this happens?
#   3. What's the difference between passing true or false to methods like:
#     * instance_methods
#     * public_methods
#     * private_methods

# Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.
#   next: jumps to the next line of the code
#   step: jumps inside a method
#   continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint
#
# USEFUL:
#   Information.instance_methods(false)
#   information.public_methods(false)
#   information.private_methods(false)
